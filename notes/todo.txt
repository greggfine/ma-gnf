drawGrid fn
    We take in numStrings, numFrets and generate a grid based on this.
        Need to draw 6 horizontal lines.
        Need to draw 12 vertical lines

Really, we're drawing POINTS here.
    The canvas lines are just "decoration".
        Each point should create a div with w/h and border and can be 


generateGrid fn
    Each point on grid should have:
        string: 6
        pitch: g
        fret: 3,
        open: false
            This should be arr of objects?


Then, how can we take this grid and use it to draw lines and frets?
    What we need is x and y coordinates
        We also need to beginPath

======================================
OR
    we create the divs in html and give each a dataset property of
        data-note: string/pitch/fret
        data-open: false
        


[
 {
    id:
    name,etc.
 }
